		<h1>Obstructive</h1>
		<p>Air is either partially or completely obstructed due to narrowing of the airways. This causes air to become trapped in the lungs. Breathlessness occurs when there is not enough time for the lungs to empty between breaths.</p>

        <h1>Restrictive</h1>
		<p>Inadequate pressure in the lungs reduces their ability to inflate when inhaling air. This means that they cannot expand to a sufficient volume, resulting in a reduced Total Lung Capacity (TLC). This contributes to breathlessness.</p>
