		<h1>Lung Diseases</h1>
		<p>In people with an obstructive lung disease, their airways are <strong>obstructed</strong>, making it harder to exhale all of the air in their lungs.</p>
		<p>In people with a restrictive lung disease, their lungs are <strong>restricted</strong> from filling entirely with air. They cannot expand to their optimal volume.</p>
