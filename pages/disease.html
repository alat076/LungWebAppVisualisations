		<h1>Lung Diseases</h1>
		<p>In people with an obstructive lung disease, their airways are <strong>obstructed</strong>, making it harder to exhale all of the air in their lungs.</p>
		<p>In people with a restrictive lung disease, their lungs are <strong>restricted</strong> from filling entirely with air. They cannot expand to their optimal volume.</p>
		<h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
		<ul>
            <li>Dyspnoea (breathlessness)</li>
            <li>Wheezing/coughing</li>
            <li>Sputum (mucus) hypersecretion</li>
            <li>Tiredness</li>
            <li>Anxiety/depression</li>
        </ul>

		<h2>Obstructive Disease</h2>
		<p>Air can be either partially or completely obstructed due to narrowing of the airways. This causes air to become trapped in the lungs. Breathlessness occurs when there is not enough time for the lungs to empty between breaths.</p>
		<h2>Restrictive Disease</h2>
		<p>Inadequate pressure in the lungs reduces their ability to inflate when inhaling air. This means that they cannot expand to a sufficient volume, resulting in a reduced Total Lung Capacity (TLC). This contributes to breathlessness.</p>
